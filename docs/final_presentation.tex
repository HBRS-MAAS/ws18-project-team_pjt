\frametitle{Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item OrderProcessing Stage:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item receive Orders from Customers
		\item check Order if it's feasible
		\item send proposal to Customer
		\item propagate scheduled Orders
	\end{itemize}
	\item DoughPreparation Stage:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item receive scheduled orders from OrderProcessing
		\item schedule daily orders on available KneadingMachines and PreparationTable
		\item send message to baking stage as soon as product is ready
	\end{itemize}
	\item Visualization:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For each order the live status of each product should be visualized
		\item not done -> Max quit the course
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{OrderProcessing Stage}
\begin{itemize}
	\item splitting OrderProcessing and Scheduling -> different tasks
	\item OrderProcessing responsible for communication with external agents
	\item SchedulerAgent checks if it's possible to schedule a specific order on a day
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{OrderProcessing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Responsible for communication with SchedulerAgent and CustomerAgent
	\item First idea -> do all communication with external agents
	\item To reduce communication with SchedulerAgent -> SchedulerAgent communicates with agents of following stages
	\item propagates to all agents of bakery that new order arrived
	\item Checks which products of order are available for each bakery
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{SchedulerAgent}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Receives orders from OrderProcessing
	\item Checks if production (doughPreparation-Stage) is possible
	\item propagates schedules order to all agents of bakery if production possible
	\item stores whole schedule for all days
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \section{Dough Manager}
%\label{anforderung}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dough Manager}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Dough Manager is responsible for kneading and preparing the product
	\item It manages its assigned prep tables and kneading machines which means
	\begin{itemize}
		\item moving one order from one state to next state
		\item check whether current stage of dough preparing is finisehd
		\item receiving orders from order processing agent
		\item sending orders to proofer
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Kneading Machine and Preparation Table}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Kneading Machine and Preparation Table}
\begin{itemize}
	\item They are represented as an object based on the same class
	\item The way we designed them there is not much functionality inside preparing machine and kneading machine
	\item Their only task it to update a counter and check whether a certain time threshold is reached
%            \begin{itemize}
%                \item moving one order from one state to next state
%                \item check whether current stage of dough preparing is finisehd
%                \item receiving orders from order processing agent
%                \item sending orders to proofer
%            \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Proofer}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Proofer}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Represents the interface between baking stage and dough preparation stage
	\item Receives kneaded and prepared products from Dough Manager
%            \item Their only task it to update a counter and check whether a certain time threshold is reached
%            \begin{itemize}
%                \item moving one order from one state to next state
